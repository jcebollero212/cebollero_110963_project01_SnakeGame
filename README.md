CECS-3210-39 P01_A Advanced Programming
Simple snake game where the user press "w" to move up, "s" to move down, "a" to move left and "d" to move right.
The code will create a snake and a random location for the snakes food (apple)
Each time the snake eats the apple, the apple will be randomly placed at another location, and deleting the one eaten. 
The snake will become larger each time it eats the apple and the game will become faster.
